# Profit Manager
A small program to calculate either the minimum price to a product based on a desired profit margin or the opposite way.

It was my first time creating an executable and I still did not know how to integrate a program with a database, so I used pandas and csv file-reading, lowering the potential to this program.

There is also Tkinter GUI, OOP and functional programming.
